        <h2>The story of ibong adarna</h2>
        <p>In the kingdom of Albania, There are 3 princes namely Don Pedro, Don Diego, and Don Juan.
          <Br> Don Pedro is described as brave and jealous of Don Juan. 
            <br> Don Diego is described as shy while Don Juan is described as brave but is also a womanizer.
            <Br> One day, The king gets sick. The mission is to find the magical bird. Don Pedro was assigned to go first since he is the eldest.
              <Br>  While walking through his journey, He encounters an old man. The old man asks for help but he refuses to help him. After this, Don Pedro finds the bird. 
                <Br>  The bird begins to sing and Don Pedro suddenly sleeps. The bird poop into Don Pedro’s body, turning him into a rock.
                  <Br> The two siblings got worried about what was happening so Don Diego decided to go next. 
                    <Br>  As same as Don Pedro, he refused to help the old man and sleep because of the bird's amazing voice, turning into rock as the bird poop. 
                      <Br> Don Juan arrives next, Unlike his sibling, he asks for blessing from his father. As he arrived, He encountered an old man.
                        <Br>  Unlike his sibling, he helps the old man and he tells Don Juan that he should injure himself and put calamari on his wound while the bird is singing.
                          <Br>   As the old man says, he follows it and later successfully overcomes it. He grabs the bird and heals his siblings.
                            <Br>  After that, They celebrated but Don Pedro and Don Diego felt jealous of Don Juan because he was the one who caught the bird and they knew that King Fernando would praise Don Juan. 
                              <Br>  They beat him up. The two princes arrive at the palace. Fernando asks where is Don Juan but they reply “I don’t know, We failed to save him”. As the bird sings, instead of healing King Fernando, his sickness worsens as he dreams about 2 thieves killing Don Juan.
                                <Br>   Instead of hatred, he just prayed to the virgin that his father should be healed. The old man healed Don Juan.
                                  <Br>    Don Juan arrives in Albania. The magical bird and Don Juan reveal the truth to the king that his brothers beat him up.
                                    <Br>     Upon revealing the truth, King Fernando punished them but Don Juan refused to. 
                                      <Br>     King Fernando wants their son to guard the bird, whoever neglects the bird will be punished. 
                                        <Br>     One day, Don Juan is sleeping and the two siblings think of betraying Don Juan again so they release the bird.
                                          <Br>      When Don Juan woke up, he was shocked because the bird was missing. He knows that his father will punish him so he decides to leave the palace.
                                            <Br>       As he arrived through his journey, there was a water well. He decided to go down. Upon going down, he sees a beautiful lady named Don Juana. 
                                              <Br>       They fall in love with each other. Don Juana warns him that a giant is guarding the garden.

                                                  <Br>       Don Juana warns Don Juan that there is a snake with 7 faces guarding that place. She warns Don Juan that if he cuts the snake's face, it will regenerate again.
                                                    <Br>        He manage to defeat the snake. Don Pedro later knew that Don Juan saved 2 beautiful princesses making him more jealous of Don Juan.
                                                      <Br>         Don Pedro and Don Diego arrived in Albania.They said to their father that they failed to find Don Juan.

                                                              <Br>         The bird suggests to Don Juan that he should go to Reino Delos Cristales in order for him to be saved since Don Pedro and Don Diego want to kill Don Juan.
                                                                <Br>         The bird suggested that he should choose Maria Blanca since she has an incomparable beauty. The eagle helped him. 
                                                                  <Br>         Don Juan sees Maria Blanca taking off her clothes. He steals it and begins kissing it. Maria Blanca noticed that her clothes were gone.

                                                                          <Br>         When King Salermo knew this, He began testing Don Juan.
                                                                            <Br>         The challenges that King Salermo conducted were scattering the wheat, Harvesting it tonight, Catching 12 negrito, Placing a mountain to his window, 
                                                                              <Br>         Putting the mountain in the middle of the sea and building a castle, removing the castle from the sea, Find his missing diamond ring, and tame the horse. 
                                                                                <Br>         Don Juan overcame these challenges with the help of Maria Blanca. He asks Don Juan to pick a finger.
                                                                                  <Br>          Each finger is composed of 3 princesses but Don Juan instantly chooses Maria Blanca's finger. 
                                                                                    <Br>          This makes the king more angry and plan.
                                                                                      <Br>           He planned that Don Juan should be married to another woman in another kingdom. 
                                                                                        <Br>           Maria Blanca later knew this and they planned to escape. As they escape, Salermo chases them and curses them that Don Juan will forget his love for Maria Blanca. 
                                                                                          <Br>           This prophecy comes true as Don Juan plans to marry Don Leonora. 
                                                                                            <Br>           Maria Blanca keeps reminding them about their love but Don Juan still can’t remember anything. 
                                                                                              <Br>           Maria Blanca decided to crack the flask down, suddenly Don Juan remembered everything. 
                                                                                                <Br>           He apologizes to Don Juan and promises to not forget her again. King Fernando was so confused about who he chose to marry his son between the two princesses. 
                                                                                                  <Br>           Don Juan decided to marry Maria Blanca since she is the one he truly loves.
                                                                                                    <Br>            Don Leonora accepts this. Don Pedro and Don Leonora ruled over the Albanya while Don Juan and Maria Blanca ruled over Reino de los Cristales. They lived happily. </p>
